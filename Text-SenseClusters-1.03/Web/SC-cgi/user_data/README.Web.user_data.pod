=head1 NAME

README.Web.user_data - [Web Interface] Description of user_data directory in Web interface

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For each instance of the web-interface a directory is created under this 
user_data directory.

These user directories remain in user_data directory until the processing is 
complete. Once the processing is complete the user directory is moved to 
htdocs/SC-htdocs directory.

If an error occurs and processing is interrupted then the user directory 
remains here.

So ideally this directory should act only as a temporary residence for these 
user directories and should contain only this README.user_data.pod file.
