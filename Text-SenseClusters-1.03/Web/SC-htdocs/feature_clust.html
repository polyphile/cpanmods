<h1>Feature Clustering (LSA)</h1>

Lexical features (unigrams, bigrams, co-occurrences, and target 
co-occurrences) are clustered in the LSA methodology based on the 
contexts in which they occur.  
<br><br>
This relies on a feature by context representation of the data, which  
indicates the contexts in which a given feature occurs. This is to be 
contrasted with the word (unigram) clustering supported by the native 
SenseClusters methodology, which clusters words based on the words with 
which they co-occur.
<br><br>
The input must be a Senseval-2 formatted test file. It can be either 
headed or headless. Even if the data has target words (headed) the 
test_scope option and target co-occurrence features are not available. 
A separate set of feature selection data (ie., training data) may 
not be used with feature clustering.
