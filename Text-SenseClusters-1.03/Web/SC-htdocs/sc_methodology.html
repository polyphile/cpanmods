The native SenseClusters methodology supports both context discrimination  
and word (unigram) clustering. Context discrimination is performed using   
either first or second order representations, and word clustering can be   
viewed as a side-effect of the second order representation. 
<br>
<br>
A first order representation creates a vector for each context that 
indicates which features (unigrams, bigrams, co-occurrence, or 
target co-occurrences) occur in that context. This results in a context  
by feature matrix that can optionally be reduced by SVD prior to 
clustering. 
<br>
<br>
A second order representation creates a vector for each context that 
indicates which words occur with the words in that context (i.e., the 
second order co-occurrences). A word by word matrix is created from a 
given set of bigrams or co-occurrences, where the rows correspond with 
the first word in the pair, and the columns with the second. This matrix  
can then optionally be reduced by SVD. Each word in the context to be 
discriminated is replaced by its corresponding vector (i.e., row) from 
this word by word matrix. All of these vectors are averaged together to 
represent the context. This averaged vector is the centroid of all the 
word vectors that make up the context. 
<br>
<br>
Word clustering treats the word by word matrix created for the second 
order representation as input to the clustering process. Words are 
clustered based on the words with which they co-occur. 
<br>
<br>
This is to be contrasted with the feature clustering supported by Latent 
Semantic Analysis, which clusters features based on the contexts in which 
they occur.
