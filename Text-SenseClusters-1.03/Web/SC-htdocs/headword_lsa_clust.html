Target word clustering takes as input multiple contexts, each of which 
includes a single target word that is marked with a special XML tag 
called "head". The object is to cluster those contexts to discover the 
different meanings of the target word. When using LSA, the premise is 
that contexts that contain words that have occurred in similar contexts 
should be clustered together.

When using LSA to carry out target word context clustering, each feature  
will be represented as a vector that shows the contexts in which it 
occurs. Each context will be represented as the average of the vectors  
associated with the features that occur around the target word in that  
context. The premise is that contexts that are made up of features that  
occur in some of the same contexts should be similar to each other.
