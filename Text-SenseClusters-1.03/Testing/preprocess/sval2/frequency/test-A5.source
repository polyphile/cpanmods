 Leeds is well <-> equipped for sports <,> with 21 golf courses and 22 sports an
d leisure centres <,> but if all this action leaves you feeling in need of a res
t <,> you can always take yourself off to the theatre <.> Leeds has four to choo
se from <.> Most famous is the Leeds City Varieties <,> one of the oldest music
halls in the country and home of BBC TV <'> s [hi] The Good Old Days [/hi] <.> T
here <'> s also the Grand Theatre <,> which hosts touring companies and is the p
ermanent home of Opera North <.> [/p] [p] One of Yorkshire <'> s famous sayings
is <&> bquo <;> Where there <'> s muck <,> there <'> s brass <&> equo <;.> And <
,> while there may not be a lot of muck any more <,> there is still plenty of br
ass <.> [/p] [p] For <,> when it comes down to it <,> there <'> s nothing to bea
t a brass band <.> There <'> s always one to be heard somewhere during the summe
r <&> mdash <;> in the piazza in front of the <<> head <>> art <</> head <>> gal
lery and Town Hall or in a park <.>

 When things are on the up and the lodestar of a transformatory politics shines
bright <,> so too does <&> bquo <;> the avant <-> garde project of overcoming th
e separation of art and life <&> equo <; (> p <.> 171 <).> [/p] [p] In this pers
pective it seems that Callinicos can only mean relatively little with his discla
imers about good art <.> The individual <&> bquo <;> good <&> equo <;> work migh
t get thrown up <,> however unpropitious the circumstance <.> But it can only be
 a quirk <;> and the force of its <&> bquo <;> goodness <&> equo <;> is strictly
 limited and circumscribed <.> Only once <,> in a fleeting reference to Matisse
is there a sense of the boot being on the other foot <,> of art offering a sense
 of liberation from social ideology <.> But even this is done in the name of a s
upposed <&> bquo <;> immediate sensuous charge <&> equo <;> rather than any more
 extended critical capacity of <<> head <>> art <</> head <>> or the aesthetic <

 The Chairman of the Chambre Nationale <,> Yannick Guilloux <,> said the charges
 brought against Britain must not be seen as the stand of one European country a
gainst another but a bid to harmonise tax regulation <,> at as low a rate as pos
sible <,> in order to protect the art market within the EC as a whole <.> The Co
mmission normally takes two months to investigate charges <,> after which it cou
ld either instruct Britain to set its VAT rates in conformity with European legi
slation or proceed to put into effect the long awaited 7th Directive on fiscal m
atters <.> A meeting of Ministers last month was once again unable to reach agre
ement on VAT <.> [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head] Manchester hosts a new British art f

riod of <<> head <>> art <</> head <>> during the last 350 years will be on disp

 Many writers interested in these phenomena tend to specialise either in child p
lay or in the arts <,> the former finding clues in the activity which relate to
child development <,> the latter establishing art as an enhancement of what is g
ood and beautiful <.> Narrowing the field to either one or the other of these <,
> has sometimes trapped the theoreticians into claiming that they have identifie
d a defining characteristic of their field <.> For instance <,> Arnaud Reid <(>
1982 <),> in arguing that what all the variety of art forms have in common is th
e requirement of <&> bquo <;> aesthetic intention <&> equo <;,> explains <:> [qu
ote] [p] For <&> mdash <;> cutting straight through the recurring controversies
about whether <,> because of the varieties of the arts and of the infinity of di
fferences between different individual works <, &> bquo <;> art <&> equo <;> can
 be <&> bquo <;> defined <&> equo <; &> mdash <;> one thing <,> I think <,> is c
lear <.> There is something common to all our experiences of <<> head <>> art <<
/> head <> ,> of whatever kind <&> mdash <;> music <,> poetry <,> painting <&> h
ellip <;,> each art concretely utterly different from the others <.>
