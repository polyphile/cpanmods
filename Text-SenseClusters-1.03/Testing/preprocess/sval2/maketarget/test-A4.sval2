 timing is critical many meetings are marred by going on and on your audience must know that you finished on time without knowing how you did it plan the schedule as a whole and in detail and write down exact timings always finish on time unless there is a very good reason to overrun be flexible with the details so that if you are getting behind you can trim the programme brief your participants that you will be conducting the meeting this way and expect their co operation leave them wanting more is a good piece of showbusiness advice if people leave feeling it was good but rather long you have failed if they leave wishing it had gone on longer you've succeeded if you are actually conducting a meeting do it with sensitivity objectivity a <head>cool</head> head and an informal personal touch

 there was the pond that lay dark and mysterious along the lower road to lulling woods mirroring the trees that stood around it sometimes in the summer paul had taken a bright wooden boat on a string and floated it there beating at the water's edge with a fan of leaves to make waves in the spring vast masses of frogs spawn floated just beneath the surface like submerged chain mail cast there by some passing knight and on one day of hard frost paul and molly had slid back and forth across the shining ice screaming with delight watched by a bold robin who sat fearlessly nearby on a low bare branch preening the pale grey feathers that edged the bronze of his breast there were other places that they loved which were accessible only in the summer there was the steep path through lulling woods <head>cool</head> as a cathedral even on the sultriest day

 when used as spot plants in groups of to corms they offer added height and mid summer interest to a mixed border planting they will need staking and tying to prevent damage from wind and when finished lift dry and store them in a frost free shed for replanting the following year i really do love the hardy gladiolus nanus such as g n white g n cream g n white pink they make ideal dwarf plants for a wide range of usages including rockeries and containers once established they can be left planted year round in my own garden they have multiplied annually noble lilies lily bulbs benefit from improved drainage and need <head>cool</head> roots so using as spot plantings amongst other perennial plants and shrubs is ideal
