1. Added --lsa option to discriminate.pl to support feature clustering using
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
								- Mahesh

2. Changed discriminate.pl to remove blank contexts when doing LSA style
feature clustering.

3. Removed dependency on Sparse module, instead replaced with use of
Math::SparseVector module.
								- Mahesh

4. Added dependency on Math::SparseMatrix module for sparse transpose
functionality to create feature-by-context LSA representation out of order 1 
context-by-feature representation.
								- Mahesh

5. Added new documentation files in web directory Web/SC-htdocs:
feature_clust.html, headless_clust.html, headword_clust.html, lsa.html,
sc_methodology.html and word_clust.html.
								- Ted

6. Updated create_gp.pl in the Web/SC-cgi directory to use gnuplot commands
in the Gnuplot version 4.0 syntax.
								- Mahesh

7. Updated web interface to support the LSA style feature clustering option
								- Mahesh

8. Changed Makefile.PL to require Math::SparseVector v0.03, Math::SparseMatrix
v0.01 and Text::NSP v1.01 and made related INSTALL file changes.
								- Mahesh

9. Changed INSTALL file to simplify setup of package, especially when 
doing a local installation. Also updated required package list to include
Math::BigInt/BigFloat. 
								- Ted

10. Now require Perl 5.8.5, since Text-NSP requires that. Also upgraded
requirement for PDL to 2.4.1, since it has been out for quite a long time
now (several years) and it seems reasonable to expect users to have 
migrated. 
								- Ted
