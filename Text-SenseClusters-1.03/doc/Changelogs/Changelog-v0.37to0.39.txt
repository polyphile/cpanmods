2.	Modified wordvec to create formatted matrix, removed precision
	option and instead added a format option 

3.	Added SVDPack support with 2 new programs -
	mat2harbo - converts a full dense matrix as created by wordvec to
	Harwell-Boeing format as required by SVDPack
	svdpackout.pl - reconstructs a matrix from its S-values and S-vectors
	created by SVDPack

5.	Modified contextvec to accept new format of wordvec

6.	Updated vector.pl wrapper to include 2 options for computing SVD -
	PDL and SVDPack [default]
