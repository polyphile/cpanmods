(2)	Added program arff2feat.pl to convert ARFF feature vectors to 
	Sense-Cluster's feature vector format. 
	This allows use of ngram/co-occurrence features as SenseTools Package 
	creates ARFF Feature vectors using ngram/co-occurrence features created
	by Ngram Statistics Package. 

(3)	Allowed Multiple Sense Tags per instance.

(4)	Fixed the bug with sorting of KEY files.

(5)	Allowed repeatition of instance ids having distinct sense ids.
	Checking for repeatition of instance ids is extended to checking 
	for repeatition of instance id and sense tag pair together.

(6)	Allowed '<','>' in instance ids and sense ids.
