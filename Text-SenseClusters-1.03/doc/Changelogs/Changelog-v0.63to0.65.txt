1. Added the logic for discriminating/unique cluster labels to                    -Anagha
   Toolkit/clusterlabel/clusterlabeling.pl 

2. Added --format option functionality for sparse representation
   of matrix in Toolkit/vector/wordvec.pl                                        -Anagha

3. Added the logic for filtering out 0's from the input matrix
   as well as the ones introduced because of formating to wordvec.pl             -Anagha

4. Re-organized controls and made some visual changes to 
   Web/SC-cgi/index.cgi
   Web/SC-cgi/second.cgi
   Web/SC-cgi/third.cgi
   Web/SC-cgi/fourth.cgi                                                         -Anagha

5. Added the following validations to discriminate.pl
   1. test scope option valid only for input data with-head tags.
   2. train scope option valid only for train data with-head tags.                -Anagha

6. Modified the logic for checking if discriminate.pl executed without
   errors in Web/SC-cgi/callwrap.pl                                               -Anagha

7. Modified Toolkit/clusterlabel/clusterlabeling.pl to give both the
   kind of labels - Descriptive and Discriminating 
   And so removed the --unique option                                             -Anagha

8. Modified Web/SC-cgi/callwrap.pl and /Web/SC-cgi/fourth.cgi for the
   changes mentioned in point #7 above                                            -Anagha

9. Changed the rank options default value to 10 from none                         -Anagha

10. Augmented the logic for removing the Null columns to 
    /Toolkit/vector/order1vec.pl, thus now svd can be used with 
    order 1 context representation.                                               -Anagha                      
 
11. Turned on the Taint mode for the SenseClusters web-interface and
    implemented the required changes in the *.cgi files.                          -Anagha

12. Added few clustering related option validations to SC web-interface           -Anagha

13. Opened up the option of performing svd with 1st order context 
    representation for the web-interface                                          -Anagha

14. Added a test-case for the modified order1vec.pl                               -Anagha
 
15. Added the svd branch for order1 representation in the flow diagram:
    /Docs/Flows/flowchart.fig and /Docs/Flows/flowchart.pdf                       -Anagha

16. Added the lower bound of 10 for svd's dimensonality reduction.                -Anagha

17. Modified the logic of checking if discriminate.pl executed without
    errors in Web/SC-cgi/callwrap.pl                                              -Anagha
