1.	Fixed bug in prepare_sval2 with regex tr/[A-Z]/a-z/ that was 
	converting characters to lower case of the next alphabet 

2.	Fixed vector.pl and Demo scripts vecrun.sh, simrun.sh 
	to balance and filter both .count and .xml files together if 
	exist. Earlier, only the file that is used by these scripts was 
	balanced/filtered.

3.	Added --nolc option to prepare_sval2.pl not to do any lowercase 
	conversion.

4.	Added similarity.sh script to Demos/Sval
