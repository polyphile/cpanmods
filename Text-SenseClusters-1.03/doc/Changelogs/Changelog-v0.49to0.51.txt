(1)	Added the new wrapper program discriminate.pl that 
	combines the order1 and order2 wrappers.
	discriminate.pl accepts the trainfile in plain text
	format rather than the Senseval-2 format.
	Also, because the training data is now in plain format,
	this wrapper no more supports the balance_train and 
	filter options on training data.

(2)	Added the cgi-bin directory to distribute the cgi scripts
	used during the NAACL-04 demo.
