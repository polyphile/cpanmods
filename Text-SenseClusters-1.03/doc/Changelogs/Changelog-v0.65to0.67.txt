1. Renamed the "co-occurrence" feature type for first order context 
   representation to "target co-occurrence" in discriminate.pl                  -Anagha

2. Made "bigram" as the default feature type for both order1 and
   order2 context representation.                                               -Anagha

3. Added the new feature type of normal "co-occurrences" to order1
   representation                                                               -Anagha

4. Added the new feature type of "target co-occurrences" to order2
   representation                                                               -Anagha

5. Updated the web-interface. Now it starts with a start-up page 
   where one can select the type of experiment (With Head, 
   Headless or Word Clustering) and then the applicable options
   are only shown on the following screens.                                     -Anagha
